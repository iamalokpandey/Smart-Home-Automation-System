# Smart-Home-Automation-System
Home Automation System is a Raspberry  Pi based home automation system which helps in automating various home appliances. The system is an efficient way of providing smart features to home when human presence is not available to operate some of the vital appliances and necessities at home. It also proves to be helpful for differently abled people or someone under medication to ease up their lives.

# Objectives
1.The projects aims on creating an affordable Home Automation System (HAS), that is able to control the home appliances without wires over Wi-Fi or Cellular Network (device) or any other means of internet on your device with effectiveness and efficiency. 
2. Controlling Home Appliances via Application - To develop an application that includes the features of switches. The application will enable the user to turn off or on the appliances with just a tap on their smartphone.
3. Secure Connection Channels between Application and Node MCU – Use of secure protocols over Wi-Fi so that other devices cannot be able to interfere with the appliances. Some options for secure point to point connection SSL and TLS. 
4 Controlled by any device capable of Wi-Fi/Cellular Internet Connection – To make the home appliances flexible in control, any device capable of Wi-Fi and cellular internet connectivity will be able to control the home appliances even from a remote location.
5. Extensible platform for future development – Creating backbone infrastructure so extensible than adding and connecting additional appliances doesn’t affect the implementation.
